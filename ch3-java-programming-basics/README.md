#### MyNumericArray.java - Custom Numeric Array

`int` array has no default methods defined on it.
Similarly storing strings in Java is not supported in primitive
data types. So there exists wrappers around default/primitive data types
to support various operations and ease of strong data.
`String`, `Integer` are such wrappers in Java to support ease of
programming.


# Lesson 2

#### HelloIndia.java

A simple class to demonstrate the usage of class, constructor,
modifier, methods etc.

#### Singleton.java

Singleton is a design pattern in Java to make sure that there is
always a single instance of a class. And there is no scope for creating
a new instance.
