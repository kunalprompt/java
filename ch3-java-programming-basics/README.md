# Lesson 1

#### Variables.java

Demonstrating the use of variable in Java.

![alt Primtive Data Types in Java](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kunalprompt/java/master/ch3-java-programming-basics/PrimitiveDataTypes.png)


#### MyNumericArray.java - Custom Numeric Array

`int` array has no default methods defined on it.
Similarly storing strings in Java is not supported in primitive
data types. So there exists wrappers around default/primitive data types
to support various operations and ease of storing data.
`String`, `Integer` are such wrappers in Java to support ease of
programming and the functionality, example storing un-signed integers.


**"Integer is a wrapper class that converts the int type
to an integer so that it can be used by the classes
that take an object as the input instead of the primitives.
ArrayList is an example of this.
This process of conversion from a primitive to an object
is known as autoboxing. If it is done in reverse — an
Integer to int conversion — it is called unboxing".**


# Lesson 2

#### HelloIndia.java

A simple class to demonstrate the usage of class, constructor,
modifier, methods etc.

#### Singleton.java

Singleton is a design pattern in Java to make sure that there is
always a single instance of a class. And there is no scope for creating
a new instance.


Questions -
Q Difference between the class, instance and local variables?

Class variables are created once with instance of a class while
instance variables are created each per instance. Local variables are
created within a scope and destroyed after the scope ends,
example variables defined in methods.
